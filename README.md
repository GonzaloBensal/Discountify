## Description & Tools

I used pure CSS and HTML to design a model page which is front-end design only.
Discountify is a discounts web page, in which you fill a register form and choose your discount to get it on your email.
It's not a whole project and will not be launched, this is for practice purposes only.


## Structure

- 3 *.png* images
- *Header* with Discountify Logo and a nav section: Home (reloads page), Products (nothing), Github (my account), Curriculum (links to my CV), Contact (nothing)
- *Searchbar* with submit button
- *Form* with two inputs, one for your name and one for your email
- *Select* element with 3 options: Black, Red (selected by default) and White
- *Radio Buttons* with discount percentage
